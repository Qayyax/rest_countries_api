# REST Countries API with color theme switcher

This is a Frontend mentor advance challenge which includes routing, REST API, theme switcher.


## What I learned from this challenge

I was able to practice React routing and got to experience how some react router works.
Routers like `Location`, `useLocation`, `Navigate`, `useNavigate` and many more.


## What I want to improve

I want to break my components more and make them simple, and not have to repeat functions accross components
